There are many projects that are being built, or intend to build, on both Polkadot and Kusama. However, there are also many that claim to do so, but actually have either no such intention, they don't have the resources to pull it through or they're outright trying to scam people by misusing the Polkadot and Kusama brands.

Telling legitimate projects from the "not so honest" ones isn't always an easy task. This guide is meant to help you in your own research in identifying whether a project is legitimate. What it's **not** meant to do, is characterise any single project as legitimate or not, or make that decision for you. It's simply a list of usual telltale signs of a legitimate project as opposed to one that's not, to help you make your own decisions.

Finally, a project being legitimate doesn't necessarily mean it will be a successful one too and this guide is definitely not meant to be viewed as financial or investment advice. Besides doing your own reserch in the legitimacy of a project, you need to do it for its success prospects too, before deciding to invest.

### "Powered by Polkadot" clarification
This statement on many projects' sites is often cause of confusion. This usually means that the project is building, or intends to build, on the Polkadot ecosystem, using Substrate. But any project can claim that, so the existence of this statement on a project's site infers no information about the legitimacy of the project and it's certainly not a "seal of approval" by Web3 Foundation.

## Signs of a legitimate project

#### 1. It has received a Web3 Grant

[Web3 Foundation Grants](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program) are a way to subsidise projects that are building on Polkadot. They have very specific criteria in order to apply and are thorougly reviewed by the review team. Once a team has achieved their first milestone, they can add the ["Web3 Grants" badge](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/grant-badge-guidelines.md) on their project's site.

Having received a grant is a strong indicator that a project is legitimate. However, it's not a guarantee that the project will deliver the end product or that it will be at the exact specifications that were originally set. Also, a project's grant can be terminated at any point if they violate the rules of the program. Furthermore, a grant **is not** an endorsement by or a partnership with Web3 Foundation. 

The full list of projects that have successfully applied for a grant can be found [here](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/accepted_grant_applications.md).

#### 2. Open source

An open source project promotes transparency, builds trust and ensures the project team isn't doing something suspicious behind the scenes. Additionally, it makes it very easy to track the progress of the project and see how active the team is in developing it.

That doesn't mean, though, that any closed source project isn't legitimate or the team behind it has something to hide. Many teams choose to keep their code private in order to protect their intellectual property. And several teams that do so have gotten a [General Grant](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program), under which their private code reviewed by members of the grants review team.

So, a project being closed source isn't necessarily a red flag, but being open source is certainly a big plus.

#### 3. Active development

If a project team constantly updates their product, this is always a good indication that the project is legitimate. Regularly releasing new features and upgrades, fixing bugs, updating their site and notifying the community of these changes, are all good earmarks of a legitimate project.

And, as mentioned above, an open source project has the additional advantage that the development activity can be easily monitored through its GitHub repo.  

#### 4. Whitepaper

The existence of a whitepaper should be considered mandatory for any project that wants to be taken seriously. However, the whitepaper needs to be more than a few infographics, some bullet points and tokenomics. A legitimate project, and even more so a serious project, will deeply analyse all aspects of their project, its use cases, what problems it aims to solve, as well as the technical aspects of the project.

A well-written, detailed whitepaper is always a good sign that the project is legitimate.

#### 5. Visible and reputable team

Legitimate projects usually display their team members prominently on their site, along with their social media (usually LinkedIn) and GitHub profiles, for development team members. This gives prospective users and investors the ability to verify the team's credentials, track records and expertise. Furthermore, having members of the core team engage directly with the community promotes trust and transparency for the project.

#### 6. Haven't issued a token on another chain

Since Polkadot and Kusama don't support smart contracts yet, it is a common practice for projects to issue tokens on Ethereum, or other chains, like Binance Smart Chain, as a means to gather funds, with the promise to migrate to a Polkadot token when that's possible. 

However, if a project has not issued tokens on another chain, this shows their dedication to the ecosystem and their dedication to actually build on Polkadot. They have no failsafe to fall to, which limits delays and removes the possibility that they may decide to not build on Polkadot after all, in favor of another blockchain.

There are, however, several projects that advertise a "multi-chain" solution. In these cases it's natural for the project to issue tokens on multiple chains, but at the same time it increases the possibility that the project may not build on Polkadot after all.

#### 7. Parachain candidate

There are many ways a project can build on Polkadot. But the most direct and impactful is by aiming to be a parachain. And finding whether a project is actually building a parachain is the easiest one: through the [Rococo testnet parachains](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains) and [parathreads](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/parachains/parathreads) pages on polkadot.js.org. Every project that aims to be a parachain will test their chain on Rococo as a parachain and a parathread before moving over to Kusama and eventually Polkadot.

Of course, getting a parachain slot on either of the two main networks is not guaranteed and the project will need to win the [auction](learn-auction) for the slots they're interested in, or they may choose to be a [parathread](learn-parathreads) instead (although this should be clarified to their community). But testing their software on the Rococo testnet is certainly a strong indicator of the legitimacy of the project.
